## Scripts Overview

### Bing Account Creator

A semi-automated process for creating a new Bing/Microsoft account. The script automates the process until email verification or captcha completion is required.

### Kroger Coupon Clipper

A Selenium IDE project that clips the maximum number of coupons on the Kroger website. Simply sign in to your account on your browser of choice and run the test to start clipping coupons directly to your Kroger card.

### Foctor AI Account Generator

An automation project to generate a new account using random details. A random email is generated with a basic password, which you can change or alter. You can then use all the free AI credits to generate images, art, or more. Log out and re-run the script to receive more free credits with a new account.
