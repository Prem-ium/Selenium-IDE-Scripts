## Demo

**Important Notice:** [`Gold Sponsors`](https://github.com/sponsors/Prem-ium) receive exclusive access to advanced scripts, such as automating the creation of Bing Rewards accounts. As of 1/9/25, Gold Sponsors will also receive automation scripts using the UI.Vision browser extension (e.g., a Kroger Account Generator).

The following is a video demo of a Gold sponsor exclusive Selenium IDE script, for automating the creation of Viki Rakuten accounts:

## Scripts Overview

**3/20/25 Update**: As of today, the Selenium IDE extension has been removed from the Chrome Web Store. You can still use the automation projects by enabling **Developer Mode** in your browser's extensions page and manually installing the extension by dragging and dropping the `Selenium-IDE.crx` file.  
Alternatively, you can download an extension called **UI.Vision**, use the **Import Selenium .side** option in its settings to convert `.side` files to `.json`, and run the automation scripts as usual.


These scripts utilize the [Selenium IDE browser extension](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide).
